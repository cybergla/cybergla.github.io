I'm a developer who's passitionate about coding and creating great products. I live in Los Angeles and I'm currently doing my Master's in Computer Science at the University of Southern California. I code mainly in Python and Java. My main interests are in Machine Learning, Data Science and Web Development. My most impressive project was when I developed a Chrome extension to filter and flag extremist webpages at AngelHack 2017 in Dubai. We won the first prize and $500 at the three day event. 

I love to play video games in my free time; I'm a huge fan of the Dark Souls series. I like to play the 
guitar and read too. I have an unhealthy addiction to Reddit and Coke Zero. Hit me up if you want me on your team and let's build great things together.
